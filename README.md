# Epidemic models for COVID-19 in South Korea, Russia and Italy Mathematical analysis

## Abstract
By using the data from US, South Korea, Brazil, India, Russia, Italy.</br>
And also adjusted the related data parameters in numerical simulations to generate forecast and the effect of prediction of the epidemic situation for each country.</br>
Meanwhile to utilize US data to compare SQIARD with SIARD, and show the effects of predictions.</br>

## Code
In order to demonstrate the result of prediction,</br>
i took three countries' data to show how we implement the data forecast by using the method of machine learning.
